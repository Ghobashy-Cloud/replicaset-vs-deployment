  <h1>Replica Sets vs. Deployments in Kubernetes</h1>

  <h2>Replica Sets</h2>
  <p>Replica Sets are Kubernetes controllers that ensure a desired number of identical pods are running at any given time.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Key features:</strong></li>
    <li>Automatic scaling based on predefined criteria</li>
    <li>Pod replacement for failed instances</li>
    <li>Selector-based management</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Deployments</h2>
  <p>Deployments are declarative Kubernetes resources that manage a desired state for a set of pods.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Key features:</strong></li>
    <li>Rolling updates for smooth application upgrades</li>
    <li>Revisions for easy rollback</li>
    <li>Health checks for monitoring pod health</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Key Differences</h2>

  <h2>Using Replica Sets and Deployments Together</h2>
  <p>Replica Sets and Deployments often work together to create robust and scalable Kubernetes applications.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Deployments define the desired number of pods.</li>
    <li>Replica Sets manage the pods created by deployments.</li>
    <li>Together, they ensure application availability and scalability.</li>
  </ul>
